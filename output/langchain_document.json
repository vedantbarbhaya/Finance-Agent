Earnings appear stagnant, with PC gaming in decline. The majority of their profit is derived from data services, rather than Al.\n\nMoreover, we're grappling with the debt ceiling limit. When analyzing patterns from past 'blood weeks', history shows NVDA experienced a 30% drop during such events. The economic outlook is not favorable and there's a downward trend, as evidenced by the overvaluation of PPD. Despite being hyped and exceeding $100 due to strong buying pressure for a significant period, it now faces a 40% reduction.\n\nAdd to that the ongoing uncertainty around the China trade war, and you have a multitude of reasons contributing to a potential decrease in the stock's value.\n\nDisclosure: I hold over 17k short positions in NVDA. My investment track record is far from flawless - I lost approximately 80k last March and, to date, Fidelity has yet to retrieve my funds. So, my struggles in the market are evident. Let's proceed.",

Now stock is up another 26%.\n\nAmazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.\n\nCan someone help me understand how NVDA has such a low short interest at these level? And literally everyone thinks this all makes sense? (Excluding redditors) i am talking about institutional investors, because at these level, they are the one moving the needle. And they clearly loading this up big time. At least for TSLA when it went on this insane run, there was lot of short interest, then S&P 500 inclusion hype, stock split, EV demand surge and 0% interest rate. \n\nTrying to figure out what these fund managers are seeing for bull case for NVDA.",

The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. \n\nI also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.\n\nI do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.\n\nSeems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?\n\n\nUpdate: I did see the +20% move after NVDA reported earnings. Luckily I did not open the short position yet. However, after briefly reading the filings I believe this could potentially be an even better short as valuation is more ridiculous",

        "content": "Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).\r  \n\r  \nThe founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.\r  \n\r\n\nNvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.  \nIt hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.  \nWith the Nasdaq Composite (\\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.  \n\"Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead,\" Wood tweeted.  \nThere will be \"dozens\" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).  \nWood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.  \n\"(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030,\" Wood wrote.  \nWith several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.\n\n  \nWood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.  \nBut as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.  \nThe fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%.",

        "content": "I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years. \n\nI also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.\n\nI do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.\n\nSeems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?",

        "content": "https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2024.html\n\nNvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.\n\nHere's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:\n\nEPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected\nRevenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected\nNvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.\n\nPrior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing \"surging demand\" for its data center products.\n\nNvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nNvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.\n\nNvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.\n\nNet income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.\n\n*Personal take*: I don\u2019t even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.\n\nAI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it\u2019s just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail.",

Ignore companies with excessive stock based compensation, the expense is real. \n\nLastly, read the investor presentation. Determine what their niche is.
